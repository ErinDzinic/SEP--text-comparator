# Software Engineering Project - Text Comparator: version 3.0

This is the final version of our project. 

We have implemented a merge function which displays a pop-up window where the user can choose to add or skip a line of text marked as a difference.
The user also has the option to cut short the choosing part and to finish it using the lines that exist only in the first or second file. 

It serves as the artifact for report: "Development and tests"

Please use "pip install -r requirements.txt" command in the console to install required modules for the app to work properly.
